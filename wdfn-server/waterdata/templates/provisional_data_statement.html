            Data are provisional and subject to revision until they have been thoroughly reviewed and received final approval.
            Current condition data relayed by satellite or other telemetry are automatically screened to not display improbable
            values until they can be verified. Provisional data may be inaccurate due to instrument malfunctions or physical
            changes at the measurement site. Subsequent review based on field inspections and measurements may result in
            significant revisions to the data. Data users are cautioned to consider carefully the provisional nature of the
            information before using it for decisions that concern personal or public safety or the conduct of business that
            involves substantial monetary or operational consequences. Information concerning the accuracy and appropriate uses
            of these data or concerning other hydrologic data may be obtained from the USGS.
