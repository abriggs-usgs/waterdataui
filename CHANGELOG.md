### Changed
- Reorganized header navigation including changing labels and adding links to twitter, instagram, and data visualizations.
## [0.48.0](https://github.com/usgs/waterdataui/compare/waterdataui-0.47.0...waterdataui-0.48.0) - 2021-06-08
### Fixed
- The method picker no longer appears briefly when selecting a parameter code with a single method.

## [0.47.0](https://github.com/usgs/waterdataui/compare/waterdataui-0.46.0...waterdataui-0.47.0) - 2021-05-11
### Changed
- Improved wording on feedback form to better steer feedback to correct destination.
- Empty sampling method descriptions now show the Method ID instead of a blank space.

## [0.46.0](https://github.com/usgs/waterdataui/compare/waterdataui-0.45.0...waterdataui-0.46.0) - 2021-04-14
### Changed
- Cleaned up the endpoint configuration names. Each distinct endpoint has its own configuration parameter and the endpoints are given more descriptive names.
- Moved sampling method selection into the parameter selection list
- Using requests sessions so that connections can be reused and give us a performance boost when loading the monitoring-location page
- The water dashboard link on the monitoring-location pages now zooms into the page's site if it is a USGS site.

### Fixed
- Flood levels are no longer rounded to an integer and show now show the decimal received from web service.
- Cleaned up empty elements for locations with no IV or GW data

## [0.45.0](https://github.com/usgs/waterdataui/compare/waterdataui-0.44.0...waterdataui-0.45.0) - 2021-03-31
### Added
- Created a new "select actions" element which appears above the parameter selection list. Allows quick show/hide of the retrieve data and change time span sections.

### Changed
- Reworked the Download data section to use radio buttons rather than links. Clicking Retrieve opens a separate tab for the selected data type. Data types reflect those that are currently shown on the graph.
- Reworked Parameter Selection Table--removed tooltips, WaterAlert subscribe, changed from table to UWSD grid, added expandable inner row.
- Reworked the Change time span section. The short cut radio buttons now appear above the select actions bar. The date range now appears first and will be used if filled in. Otherwise, the Days before Today section will be used.

### Fixed
- Estimated points are now the correct color, even when the data services return multiple qualifer codes.
- Precipitation scale is now correctly determined.

## [0.44.0](https://github.com/usgs/waterdataui/compare/waterdataui-0.43.0...waterdataui-0.44.0) - 2021-03-17
### Changed
- The data loading indicator for the hydrograph now appears on top of the graph rather than with the date controls.
- Cleaned up hydrograph rendering and made changes to make it possible to determine when rendering of the hydrograph is complete.
- If no method id is selected, the initial method ID is now determined by picking the IV time series with the most points. If more than one has the most points, the time series with the most
recent data is chosen. 
- Floating feedback link is now centered on page (and networks page) and an additional link added to header.
- Changed label order and label wording for the 'custom' option in time selection menu.
- WaterAlert subscription is now in the expanded row of the parameter list. 

### Added
- If the graph shows no data for the selected time range, a message will appear on top of the graph. In addition, if a particular kind of selected data isn't available (for instance if compare to last year is selected and there is no data for that time range)

### Fixed
- Flood lines are now only rendered if in range of the Y axis.

## [0.43.0](https://github.com/usgs/waterdataui/compare/waterdataui-0.43.0...waterdataui-0.42.0) - 2021-03-01

- The parameter selection list now shows parameters that are groundwater field visits only in addition to parameters that have IV data.
- The period of record in the parameter selection list reflects the period of record of groundwater field visits. If both field visits and IV data are available, the period of record is the union.

## [0.40.0](https://github.com/usgs/waterdataui/compare/waterdataui-0.39.0...waterdataui-0.40.0) - 2021-01-06
